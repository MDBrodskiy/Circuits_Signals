\begin{itemize}

  \item Action Potential

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Depolarization or Spikes

      \item Electrical response to adequate stimulation; consists of ``all-or-none'' action potential after the cell threshold potential has been reached

      \item Requires activating potential ($\approx 100[\si{\milli\volt}]$ for $1[\si{\milli\second}]$)

      \item Transient change in membrane permeability to:

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Na$^+$

          \item K$^+$

        \end{itemize}

      \item Specificity results from protein shape (conformation)

    \end{itemize}

  \item EKG

    \begin{itemize}

      \item EKG is always measured between pairs of electrodes called ``leads''

      \item Why biopotential is always measured between pairs

        \begin{itemize}

          \item In practice, interference is significant

          \item As such, we can reject signals that appear at both inputs and amplify (measure) the difference

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}
