\begin{itemize}

  \item Circuit Equivalence

    \begin{itemize}

      \item If there are two circuits, and the same voltage, $v_a$ is applied to both, if $I_A=I_B$ then the circuits are considered equivalent

      \item Same thing for same current applied and same voltage output

    \end{itemize}

  \item Resistor Equivalence

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Resistors can be connected in circuits like a delta connection

      \item As well as a Y connection

      \item A delta connection can be transformed into a Y connection and vice versa using transformation technique

      \item This will often help in circuits

    \end{itemize}

  \item Transformations can be established from one to the other, as shown in Figure 1, using the following

    $$\boxed{R_1=\frac{R_bR_c}{R_a+R_b+R_c},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,R_2=\frac{R_cR_a}{R_a+R_b+R_c},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,R_3=\frac{R_aR_b}{R_a+R_b+R_c}}$$
    $$\boxed{R_a=\frac{R_1R_2+R_2R_3+R_3R_1}{R_1},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,R_2=\frac{R_1R_2+R_2R_3+R_3R_1}{R_2},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,R_c=\frac{R_1R_2+R_2R_3+R_3R_1}{R_3}}$$

\end{itemize}
