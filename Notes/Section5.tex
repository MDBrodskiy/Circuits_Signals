\begin{itemize}

  \item Circuit Equivalence

    \begin{itemize}

      \item If there are two circuits, and the same voltage, $v_a$ is applied to both, if $I_A=I_B$ then the circuits are considered equivalent

      \item Same thing for same current applied and same voltage output

    \end{itemize}

  \item Resistor Equivalence

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Resistors can be connected in circuits like a delta connection

      \item As well as a Y connection

      \item A delta connection can be transformed into a Y connection and vice versa using transformation technique

      \item This will often help in circuits

    \end{itemize}

  \item Transformations can be established from one to the other, as shown in Figure 1, using the following

    $$\boxed{R_1=\frac{R_bR_c}{R_a+R_b+R_c},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,R_2=\frac{R_cR_a}{R_a+R_b+R_c},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,R_3=\frac{R_aR_b}{R_a+R_b+R_c}}$$
    $$\boxed{R_a=\frac{R_1R_2+R_2R_3+R_3R_1}{R_1},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,R_2=\frac{R_1R_2+R_2R_3+R_3R_1}{R_2},\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,R_c=\frac{R_1R_2+R_2R_3+R_3R_1}{R_3}}$$

  \item A voltage source with a series resistor can be transformed into a current source with a resistor in parallel, as shown in Figure 2

      \include{Figures/vtoc}
      \caption{Converting Between Voltage and Current}
      \label{fig:2}
    \end{figure}

  \item A parallel resistor with a voltage source can be removed (replaced by an open) for transformation, as shown in Figure 3

    \begin{figure}[H]
      \centering
      \include{Figures/Vopen}
      \caption{Converting Voltage Sources}
      \label{fig:3}
    \end{figure}

  \item A series resistor with a current source can be removed (replaced by a short) for transformation, as shown in Figure 4

    \begin{figure}[H]

      \include{Figures/Cshort}

  \item Some systems may be very complex, but we may be only interested in how it behaves at two terminals

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Actual circuit can be converted into an equivalent circuit, called Thevnin equivalent

      \item It essentially replaces the actual circuit with a voltage source with a series resistor

      \item The voltage source is called the Thevnin voltage $V_{TH}$

      \item The equivalent input resistance is called the Thevnin resistor $R_{TH}$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Thevnin Equivalence is a two-step process:

    \begin{enumerate}

      \item Analyze the circuit and find the open circuit voltage $v_{oc}$

      \item Analyze the circuit and find the short circuit current across the terminal $i_{sc}$

    \end{enumerate}

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Some circuits only work properly over a certain range of loads (not with $R_L=0$, for example)

      \item For this type of circuit, to determine $R_{TH}$ use an acceptable $R_L$ and compute $R_{TH}$ by using the voltage divider equation shown below

        $$V_{RL}=V_{TH}\frac{R_L}{R_{TH}+R_L}$$

      \item Note that only the process of determining $R_{TH}$ is changed

    \end{itemize}
    
  \item Norton Equivalent

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Norton equivalent consists of a Norton current source in parallel with a Norton resistor

      \item It's a dual of Thevnin equivalent circuit, and one can be derived from the other

      \item It can be deduced from the source transform

        $$\boxed{i_{nor}=\frac{V_{TH}}{R_{TH}}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,R_{TH}=R_{nor}}$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item Determining $R_{TH}$

    \begin{itemize}

      \item In a circuit with ideal voltage and/or current source\footnote{Note: This technique does not apply when there are dependent sources in the circuit}

      \item Replace the voltage source with a short and a current source with an open

      \item Find the equivalent resistance across $a$ and $b$ using resistor transform

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
