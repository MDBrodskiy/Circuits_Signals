\begin{itemize}

  \item What is an inductor?

    \begin{itemize}

      \item An electrical component that opposes change in electric current

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Unlike a resistor, which opposes the flow of current

        \end{itemize}

      \item Made by putting a coil of wire around a magnetic or non-magnetic core

      \item Source of inductance is change in magnetic field

      \item Current causes magnetic field and change in current causes change in magnetic field, which induces voltage in conductors (inductance)

      \item Mathematical Relation

        $$\boxed{v=L\frac{di}{dt}}$$

      \item $L$ is the inductance and its SI unit is Henry ($\si{\henry}$)

      \item Notice the direction of current and voltage drop

      \item Mathematical Relation\footnote{If voltage is given}

        $$i(t)=\frac{1}{L}\int_{t_0}^t vdt+i(t_0)$$

    \end{itemize}
