\begin{itemize}

  \item Natural Response

    \begin{itemize}

      \item An inductor or a capacitor can store energy when charge by current or a voltage source

      \item If they are abruptly disconnected, they will lose energy through a resistor

      \item The timing response of the circuit is called the natural response

    \end{itemize}

  \item Time Constant

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Notice the equation

      $$\boxed{i(t)=I_0e^{\dfrac{-Rt}{L}}}$$

      \item The term $\dfrac{L}{R}$ is called the time constant of the circuit

      \item The equation can be changed to:

        $$\boxed{i(t)= I_0e^{-\dfrac{t}{\tau}}}$$

        \item Time constant is represented as $\tau$ and is the time it takes for the current to reduce to 37\% of original value

        \item When we say long time, we typically mean 5 or more time constants

        \item Momentary events such as opening of the switch and circuit response that follows is called transient response

        \item The response of the circuit after a long time (several time constants) is called the steady-state response

    \end{itemize}

  \item Step Response of an RL Circuit

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Step response of a circuit is the timing response when you suddenly apply a voltage or current source across resistor

      \item Applying KVL, the differential equation comes out to be:

        $$\boxed{-V_s+iR+L\dfrac{di}{dt}=0}$$

      \item Solving this, we obtain:

        $$\boxed{i(t)=\dfrac{V_s}{R}+\left(I_0-\dfrac{V_s}{R}\right)e^{-\frac{R}{L}t}}$$

    \end{itemize}

  \item RC Circuit

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The differential equation for an RC Circuit is:

        $$\boxed{-I_s+\dfrac{v}{R}+C\dfrac{dv}{dt}=0}$$

      \item Solving this equation, we get:

        $$\boxed{I_sR+(V_0-I_sR)e^{-\frac{t}{RC}}}$$

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
