  \item Natural Response

    \begin{itemize}

      \item An inductor or a capacitor can store energy when charge by current or a voltage source

      \item If they are abruptly disconnected, they will lose energy through a resistor

      \item The timing response of the circuit is called the natural response

    \end{itemize}

  \item Time Constant

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Notice the equation

      $$\boxed{i(t)=I_0e^{\dfrac{-Rt}{L}}}$$

      \item The term $\dfrac{L}{R}$ is called the time constant of the circuit

      \item The equation can be changed to:

        $$\boxed{i(t)= I_0e^{-\dfrac{t}{\tau}}}$$

        \item Time constant is represented as $\tau$ and is the time it takes for the current to reduce to 37\% of original value

        \item When we say long time, we typically mean 5 or more time constants

        \item Momentary events such as opening of the switch and circuit response that follows is called transient response

        \item The response of the circuit after a long time (several time constants) is called the steady-state response

    \end{itemize}
