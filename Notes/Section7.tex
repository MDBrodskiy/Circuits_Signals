\begin{itemize}

  \item What is a System?

    \begin{itemize}

      \item From electrical engineering perspective, a system is device or a group device or a set-up that takes an input signal $x$ and manipulates it to generate a signal $y$

      \item Add another layer of abstraction over circuit (or other) models

      \item Can allow us to think about, analyze, and design circuits while paying attention only to what is important in a particular setting and ignoring lots of other details

    \end{itemize}

  \item Complex Numbers

    \begin{itemize}

      \item The imaginary numbers consist of all numbers $bi$, where $b$ is a real number and $i$ is the imaginary unit, with the property that $i^2=-1$

      \item The first four powers of $i$ establish an important pattern and should be memorized:

        $$\boxed{i^1=i\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,i^2=-1\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,i^3=-i\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,i^4=1}$$

      \item The complex numbers consist of all sums $a + bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers and $i$ is the imaginary unit.  The real part is $a$, and the imaginary part is $bi$

      \item Conjugates

        \begin{itemize}

          \item The conjugate of $a+bi$ is $a-bi$

          \item The conjugate of $a-bi$ is $a+bi$

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Systems

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Physical System

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Defining a system involves drawing a boundary around some part of the world (or conceptually, inside a computational device) so that quantities external to those boundaries may influence what happens inside the boundaries (the ``inputs'' to the system)

        \end{itemize}

      \item Mathematical System

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
