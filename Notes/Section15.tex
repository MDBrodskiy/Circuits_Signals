\begin{itemize}

  \item Sampling

    \begin{itemize}

      \item To be able to process the analog signal with digital computers, we need to digitize the analog signal

      \item It introduces noise due to quantization

      \item Sampling rate is the rate at which samples are taken (in Hertz)

    \end{itemize}

  \item The Nyquist Theorem

    \begin{itemize}

      \item States that in order to adequately reproduce a signal, it should be periodically sampled at a rate that is two times the highest frequency you wish to record

    \end{itemize}

  \item Analog Filtering

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Typically designed for frequency selectivity

      \item Typically using circuits and circuit devices

      \item ``Real-time'' and fast

      \item Filter settings can be hard to change

      \item Filtering necessary before A/D

    \end{itemize}

  \item Digital Filter Design

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Two Common Approaches

        \begin{itemize}

          \item Approximate analog filters directly

        \end{itemize}

    \end{itemize}

  \item Trade-offs

    \begin{itemize}

      \item Design from analog generally much lower order for same specifications

      \item Design from digital allows control over phase behavior, greater flexibility in frequency response, and tolerance specifications

      \item Design from digital can be more stable in finite precision

    \end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
